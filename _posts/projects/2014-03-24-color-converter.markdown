		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p>The app was specifically targeted toward people who understand colors and the various color models. There are not a lot of visual queues or explanations because they would take  up valuable screen space and possibly users time.</p>
		<p>With this type of user in mind, it was our goal to create something that had <b>efficient use of screen space</b> and was as <b>quick as possible</b> for the user.</p>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>It was important that the app had all of the important color models, but we also were confined to a tight space so we had to make cuts. Eventually we decided on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Hexadecimal</li>
			<li>RGB</li>
			<li>CMYK</li>
			<li>HSL</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The RGB/Hex were obvious because of their strong history as web colors and the basic color model used by all color screens. Even if we decided not to include it, it would still have to be calculated to display the color.</p>
		<p>CMYK was chosen because of the strong history as the defacto print color. We anticipate that RGB to CMYK and vice versa will be the most common use of Color Converter.</p>
		<p>HSL was included because it can now also be used for web colors and provides a completely different way to easily manipulate the colors. In order to drop the saturation or lightness, users can just manipulate that field instead of changing all three if they were working exclusively with RGB.</p>
