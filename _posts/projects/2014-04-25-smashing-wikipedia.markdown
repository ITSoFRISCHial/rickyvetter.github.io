		<p>Smashing Wikipedia cuts Wikipedia articles down to a single paragraph. It is an easy way to browse random (or specific) articles. It was made as a personal project to get experience working with APIs.</p>
		<p>It was built to be mobile friendly, with the "Random!" button always available to take you to the next article. However, a keyboard adds quite a bit more functionality. In order to make it easy for desktop users, forward, back, random and "open in Wikipedia" are all triggered by key presses.</p>

		<p>I did all of the design and development of the site. I started by creating a layout in browser, adding sample content and then tweaking the design for desktop users. I then added JavaScript and added button/keyboard controls.</p>
