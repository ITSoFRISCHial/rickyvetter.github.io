So far using Jekyll has been going smoothly. It certainly isn't as full-featured as some of the Content Management Systems, but it does some really powerful stuff really quickly.

Pros
----
1. Powerful use of includes and variables make it so I'm not spending a lot of time manipulating HTML. I can focus on style and content more than I even have before.
2. It's really quick to update or add content, and it doesn't take a lot tools. All I need is a text editor and a way to save that file to my repository. That means it's stupid simple from my computer and easy to swing on the go.

Cons
----
1. It isn't dynamic. At the end of the day, there are some really interesting things that I would like to try out, but that Jekyll doesn't let me do.

Conclusion
----------
It's a great tool that makes building templated static sites a breeze.
