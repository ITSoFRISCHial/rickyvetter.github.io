So far using Jekyll has been going smoothly. It certainly isn't as full-featured as some of the Content Management Systems, but it does some really powerful stuff really quickly.
Pros
----
1. Powerful use of includes, with variables make it so I'm not spending a lot of time manipulating HTML. I can focus on style and content more than I even have before.
2. It's really quick to update or add content, and it doesn't take a lot tools. All I need is a text editor and a way to save that file to my repository. On my own computer I don't have to remember a password, or even open up a browser.

Cons
----
1. It can sometimes seem so powerful I want to believe that I can add dynamic content to it. I find myself more drawn to try and add things that are difficult without server side code.

I'll write more on this topic at a later date. I'm dead tired and I just wanted to get this down before I head to bed. Goodnight! Happy Halloween<pre>Hello</pre>.
