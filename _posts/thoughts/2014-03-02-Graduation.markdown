*This post doesn't strictly fit with the professional/technology leaning of my site, but I have not written a post in a long time and I wanted to get something up. This is what I'm thinking about now.*

I graduate this May, and it's really starting to sink in. It's stressful to know that in a few short months I will officially begin the "next chapter" of my life. I think a lot of that stress comes from being unsure about what role is the best fit for me. My degrees in psychology and advertising are strong matches for user experience roles, but I don't know that I stand out as a technically competent candidate.

Beyond my own personal worries (which I'm sure are shared by a number of the class of 2014), there is the general stress of graduation. I know hardly anything about the next few months. Where will I be living? Which of my friends and family will I be able to see on a regular basis? Will I be making good money, floating by, or something worse? Will there even be job opportunities? Will I wear the tassel on the right side?

I don't know the answers to any of these questions and I am not comfortable with that. In fact, this may be the most uncomfortable I've been with my personal situation before. That's alright. I am not comfortable, but I am confident in my abilities and skillset. I may not know where I'll be or what I'll be doing in September, but I do know that I'll be doing something that's meaningful to me and I know that I'll be doing it well.

Best of luck to the graduates of 2014!
